<p> Cannery Row is the most popular vacation destination on the coast. Originally Cannery Row
was an industrial row full of whaling and a main sardine industry. Over the years the area 
has been restored and developed into a modern representation with many shops, restaurants, and
activities to do on Cannery Row!</p>
