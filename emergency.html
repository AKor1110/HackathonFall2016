<p>  The University Police Department provides several emergency call boxes with blue lights
above them. If you need help, use the box and an officer will respond. The Campus University
 Police also provides a free Night Walk service. If you are out alone after dark and do not
 feel comfortable walking by yourself, you can use the Night Walk service and walk with an
  officer.
